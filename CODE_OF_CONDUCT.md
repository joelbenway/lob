# Code of Conduct for the lob Project

Whatever community this project is lucky enough to marshal shall govern themselves according to the Scout Oath and Scout Law as championed by the Boy Scouts of America. These and similar doctrines used by scouting organizations worldwide have a proven history of cultivating growth, strong character, and a fun environment among boys and men alike. These are welcome outcomes for an open source software project. They also have the benefit of already being memorized by many.

## The Scout Oath

On my honor, I will do my best
To do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law;
To help other people at all times;
To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight. 

## The Scout Law

A Scout is:

* Trustworthy,
* Loyal,
* Helpful,
* Friendly,
* Courteous,
* Kind,
* Obedient,
* Cheerful,
* Thrifty,
* Brave,
* Clean,
* and Reverent.

## Conflict Resolution

Should conflicts arise, they should be addressed in a manner consistent with the principles above. Efforts shall be made to resolve disagreements through respectful discussion and mutual understanding. Community members are encouraged to be as charitable and patient as possible. If goodwill becomes impossible, project leadership has a responsibiliy to shepherd the project and community by tending to the lost or expelling wolves. Please reach out to project leadership if you believe action is required.

## Final Thoughts

By following this code of conduct, including the Boy Scout Oath and Law, we can ensure that any community lob enjoys can work and build together. Thank you for being a part of the journey and for contributing to a positive and productive environment!
