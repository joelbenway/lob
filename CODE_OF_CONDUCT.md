# Code of Conduct for the lob Project
Lob is not trying to marshal contributors, a community, or even users but what collaboration exists shall govern itself according to the Scout Oath and Scout Law as championed by the Boy Scouts of America. These and similar doctrines usedby scouting organizations worldwide have a proven history of cultivating growth, strong character, and a fun environment among boys and men alike. These are welcome outcomes for an open source software project. They also have the benefit of already being memorized by lob's author.

## The Scout Oath
On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.

* Trustworthy
